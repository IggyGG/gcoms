# Rust integration qualification

- Compile independent `ipc,files` and `embedded,files,gc2-carrier` consumers.
  Reject host/crypto/MLS/RPC dependencies in the IPC graph and forced Tokio
  multithread runtimes in either integration.
- Run SDK version/capability tests and facade backend tests, including encrypted
  cache reopen, bounded upload/export, forbidden scope and destination overwrite.
- Retain runtime durability/shutdown/GC2 bootstrap tests extracted from GChat.
  Verify file receive progress while outbound receipts are stalled.
- Run existing swarm corruption, quota, resumability and membership tests.
- Test GChat against this exact source pair, preserve archive/cache fixtures, run
  formatting, lint, package-consumer and generated-contract gates.
- Measure stripped consumer executables for opt-level 3/s/z with LTO, one codegen
  unit and unwind. Record the host separately from IPC consumer bytes.
- Execute integration tests and size checks natively on Linux x86_64 and macOS
  arm64/x86_64. Cross compilation alone is not native qualification.

Results remain pending until their commands succeed; historical branch evidence
is retained separately and does not qualify the current inputs.
