# GComs

Rust applications start with the [`gcoms` application API](crates/application/README.md):
one dependency for messaging, channels and files. Select `ipc,files` for a small
client of an existing host, or `embedded,files,gc2-carrier` for an in-process relay.
RPC and automatic daemon launch are optional. GChat consumes the same API.

**GComs** is a Rust communication protocol for secure connections, with typed
service APIs for addon and client integration. **GChat** is its separate reference
application, with a desktop UI, terminal UI and local service.

Development and release authority remains in the existing local Forgejo repository.
Public delivery uses [IggyGG/gcoms](https://github.com/IggyGG/gcoms) and
[IggyGG/gchat](https://github.com/IggyGG/gchat) as GitHub mirrors.
The first signed release is being prepared for Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64,
and macOS Apple Silicon/Intel. See [release preparation](docs/RELEASE.md).

## Start here

- [Typed services and addon integration](docs/TYPED_SERVICES.md): shared Rust traits,
  generated clients, TypeScript and Rust/WASM browsers, durable operation handles.
- [Private piece exchange](docs/PRIVATE_FILES.md): resumable, encrypted multi-source file transfer.
- [Isolated GChat capture calibration](docs/GCHAT_CLIENT_CAPTURE.md): actual-daemon
  observation and validity checks, separate from privacy and fleet qualification.
- [SDK](crates/sdk/README.md): embedded runtime or capability-scoped local IPC.
- [Runnable addon](examples/typed-addon/README.md): one contract and multiple clients.
- [Implemented protocol profile](SPEC.md), [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
  [compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md), [security](SECURITY.md).
- [Build and test](TESTING.md), [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md), [license](LICENSE-MIT).
- [Repository ownership and source integration](docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md),
  [relay research](docs/RELAY_RESEARCH.md), and the
  [GC/2 implementation ledger](docs/GC2_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

After package publication, a native client can depend on:

```toml
[dependencies]
gcoms-rpc = "0.1.0"
# For low-level messaging without embedding a node:
gcoms-sdk = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false, features = ["ipc"] }
```

The same service trait generates Rust clients and dispatchers. Calls cross an
explicit transport: in-process dispatch, a local socket/named pipe, authenticated
GComs peers, or a browser HTTP gateway. A call can fail after its remote effect;
operations expose durable status and resume rather than silently repeating work.

## Repository layout

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/core`, `protocol` | Wire framing and portable codecs |
| `crypto`, `mls`, `transport`, `routing`, `gossip` | Encryption, groups and network transport |
| `node`, `network`, `network-client`, `catalog` | Runtime and operator-configured discovery |
| `sdk`, `file-transfer`, `private-fs` | Application integration and local storage boundaries |
| `rpc-contract`, `rpc-macros`, `rpc` | Typed service contracts, generation and runtime |
| `packages/gc-rpc`, `packages/rpc-codegen` | `@gcoms/rpc` runtime and build-time code generator |
| `conformance`, `sim`, `fuzz`, `examples` | Fixtures, models and development tools |

GComs does not embed a production network or a Ghost deployment. Hosts supply
network trust and local authority policy. Ghost fleet, recorder, machine-agent,
managed command and installer implementations remain in their private repositories.
Historical reserved wire identifiers do not imply those implementations are present.

## Build

Rust 1.98, Node 22 and npm 11 are the tested toolchain baseline. From this checkout:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --test-threads=1
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run generate
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
```

Native libraries and target prerequisites are described in TESTING.md. Development
adds `proc-macro-crate` for dependency-alias-aware macros, and `libfuzzer-sys` in the
isolated fuzz workspace. Ajv belongs only to `@gcoms/rpc-codegen`; the packaged
JavaScript runtime has no runtime npm dependencies.

Dual licensed under **MIT OR Apache-2.0**. Attribution and dependency terms are in
[NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md). Naming changes do not change GC/1 wire bytes.

The preview pins rustls >=0.23.45 and quick-xml >=0.41 for current advisory fixes,
uses rustls-pki-types' PEM parser, and disables unused postcard heapless defaults.
`deny.toml` records exact transitive-version exceptions and one reviewed build-time
unmaintained hax/libcrux macro dependency; it does not waive runtime vulnerabilities.

The application/runtime consolidation reuses existing dependencies; `sha2` derives
a purpose-specific host cache key. TLS fixture dependencies (`rcgen`, `rustls`,
`tokio-rustls`) are test-only in the runtime. No new third-party package is added.

Both Rust integrations are tested natively on Linux x86_64 and macOS arm64/x86_64.
Measured sizes and exact validation inputs are in [the Rust integration report](docs/RUST_INTEGRATIONS.md).
